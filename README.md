## I. Executive Summary

This analysis reveals a strong positive correlation between departure and arrival delays, with no influence from flight distance. Airlines like Delta, JetBlue, and United perform efficiently despite high traffic, while ExpressJet, Frontier, and Mesa struggle with delays, suggesting operational challenges. Monthly trends show higher delays during peak travel periods (June–July, December), and hourly patterns highlight increased delays from 15:00 to 21:00, peaking between 19:00–21:00. Among the origin airports, EWR records the longest delays due to its high volume, while JFK and LGA demonstrate better efficiency. Notably, destinations like RIC and MKE consistently suffer from delays, indicating systemic issues.

To address these challenges, targeted improvements are recommended: optimize EWR operations, maintain JFK’s efficiency, and streamline LGA’s processes during peak hours. Addressing persistent delays at destinations like RIC and managing flight volumes during peak months can reduce congestion. Leveraging traffic data for better fleet and schedule management, especially during high-delay hours, can improve overall punctuality. Enhanced coordination between airports, airlines, and ground teams will be key in delivering a more efficient and reliable travel experience.

## II. Background

Flight delays are a significant issue in the aviation industry, affecting millions of passengers every year. These delays not only lead to frustration for travelers but also cause operational inefficiencies for airlines and airports. Understanding the factors that contribute to delays—such as airline performance, time of day, and airport conditions—can help improve punctuality and reduce the impact on passengers.

This analysis is crucial because it identifies patterns and trends that can help stakeholders, including airlines, airports, and passengers, make informed decisions. By uncovering the root causes of delays, airlines can optimize their operations, airports can improve traffic management, and passengers can better anticipate and plan for disruptions. This work is especially important as air travel continues to grow, and the demand for more efficient flight operations increases.

## III. Objectives
The primary goal of this project is to analyze flight delay data and uncover patterns related to airlines, airports, and time factors. The analysis will address the following key questions:

1. **Airline Performance**: How do different airlines compare in terms of their departure and arrival times? Are there noticeable trends in their on-time performance over the course of the year?
   
2. **Delays by Time**: Are there specific months, weeks, or times of the day where there is a general trend of greater delays across all carriers? What factors could contribute to these delays?

3. **Airport Performance**: How do different airports compare in terms of departure and arrival punctuality? What role do factors like location, traffic volume, and operational efficiency play in delays? Are there patterns in delays across various airports?

By answering these questions, the analysis will provide actionable insights into the operational challenges airlines and airports face, with a focus on identifying specific time periods and locations where improvements could reduce delays.

## V. Data Quality Check and Cleaning

### Data Quality Check

I checked the dataset’s quality by first looking at a preview using `df.head()` and making sure all columns were visible. I then looked at the unique values in each column with `df.nunique()` and checked the data types using `df.dtypes`. I looked for duplicates using `df.duplicated().sum()` and checked for missing values with `df.isnull().sum()`, focusing on columns with missing data. This helped me find problems like missing values, duplicates, and wrong data types, making sure the data is reliable before cleaning.

### Data Cleaning

I cleaned the dataset by first removing rows with missing values using `df.dropna()`. Then, I converted the month numbers to their corresponding names using a mapping dictionary. I also standardized the time columns (`'dep_time'`, `'sched_dep_time'`, `'arr_time'`, and `'sched_arr_time'`) to a consistent `HHMM` format and handled the 2400 values appropriately. Lastly, I converted the `'dep_delay'`, `'arr_delay'`, and `'air_time'` columns from float to integer to ensure consistency. These steps helped prepare the dataset for analysis.

## VI. Insight Deep-dive
### Relationship Between Departure and Arrival Delays Based on Flight Distance

- The scatter plot shows a strong positive correlation between departure and arrival delays—flights that depart late tend to arrive late, while early departures often lead to early arrivals
- There are some extreme outliers with very high delays. These may represent exceptional cases, like weather disruptions or technical issues.
- Flight distance shows no significant correlation with delays; both short-haul and long-haul flights follow a similar pattern—arrival delays increase with departure delays, and early departures often lead to early arrivals.

## VII. Recommendations

# Recommendations

- **Improve Operations at EWR**
    - To address EWR’s significant delays—15 minutes for departures and 9 minutes for arrivals—airport management and operations teams should focus on reducing congestion and better handling weather disruptions. With the airport handling over a third of the total flight volume, these delays compound quickly. Strategies include adjusting flight schedules to reduce peak-hour pressure, improving air traffic coordination, strengthening communication with airlines, and enhancing weather-related response protocols.

- **Reduce Delays at LGA**  
    - At LGA, 33.8% of flights are delayed by more than 15 minutes. To improve, airport management and airlines should upgrade delay management systems. Streamlining the boarding process, boosting staff capacity during busy times, and enhancing coordination between air and ground teams can help improve efficiency and reduce disruptions.

- **Maintain Efficiency at JFK**  
    - JFK has relatively low delay rates, with only 31.4% of flights delayed over 15 minutes. To keep this performance, airport management should maintain current practices and invest in predictive scheduling tools and real-time data systems. These steps will help JFK continue delivering reliable service while managing high traffic volumes.


- **Address Recurring Delays at RIC, MKE, IAD, and ORF**  
  - Airports like RIC, MKE, IAD, and ORF show recurring delays, with RIC standing out at over 23 minutes for departures. Authorities at these airports need to investigate the causes, such as airspace congestion or infrastructure limitations. Improvements in air traffic management, infrastructure upgrades, and tighter coordination with airlines are necessary to reduce inefficiencies.


- **Manage Peak Season Flight Volume**  
  - Flight volumes increase significantly in June, July, and December, contributing to more delays. Airport managers, airlines, and scheduling teams should adjust flight schedules to avoid peak-hour clustering. Enhancing queuing systems and baggage handling during these months can help maintain smoother operations and better passenger flow.

- **Use Traffic Data to Optimize Fleet Scheduling**  
  - Airlines like Delta and JetBlue, which manage high volumes yet maintain lower delays, show that effective fleet management works. Airline fleet teams should use traffic data insights to improve scheduling. Those with lower traffic should explore scalable fleet strategies that maintain efficiency as demand grows.


- **Monitor and Adjust for Time-of-Day Delays**  
  - Delays spike between 3 PM and 9 PM, peaking at 24 minutes between 7 PM and 9 PM. Airport operations and airline schedulers should respond by adding staff during these hours and adjusting departure times to reduce bottlenecks. These changes can significantly ease congestion during peak hours.


- **Strengthen Coordination Across Stakeholders**  
  - At busy airports like EWR, JFK, and LGA, better collaboration between airport authorities, airlines, and ground handling teams is key. Establishing joint task forces, improving data sharing, and coordinating operations like gate assignments and baggage handling can reduce delays and streamline overall airport performance.
 
By focusing on airport-specific issues, adjusting to seasonal and hourly flight patterns, and promoting better coordination across the industry, delays can be reduced, operations can become more efficient, and the overall travel experience can be improved for passengers.
